# Temp-Calculator
This program will ask for the temperature (in Fahrenheit), the dew point (in Fahrenheit), and The wind speed (in MPH). With this information the program will calculate the wind chill also known as the feels like temperature (in Fahrenheit). It will also calculate the cloud base (in Feet). It then will display these in an organized table.
