This program will ask for the temperature (in Fahrenheit), the dew point (in Fahrenheit), The wind speed (in MPH), and the elevation (in Feet). With this information the program will calculate the wind chill also known as the feels like temperature (in Fahrenheit). It will also calculate the cloud base (in Feet). It then will display these in an organized table.
